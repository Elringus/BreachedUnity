TooltipPanelAvatar,Name's Corus. Will tell you more when we clarify the situation.
TooltipPanelAvatarCondition,My hibernation was interrupted. Better to watch after vital parameters carefully.
TooltipPanelStatus,Machine is damaged and I have a very little amount of oxygen. Already feeling hypoxia...
TooltipButtonEndDay,Even now rest is neccessary. I will do more tomorrow.
TooltipButtonToBridge,My main deck. I keep journal and condition reports here.
TooltipButtonToWorkshop,My workshop deck. For the urgent oxygen production and repair.
TooltipButtonToMap,Map deck. To scan what's around my machine.
TooltipButtonToHorizon,"Chamber to relax and meditate. Also, the machine produces great illusions sometimes..."
TooltipButtonToMenu,Main menu
TooltipTextDate,I was awakened earlier than needed. Much earlier.
TooltipClock,My productive time for this day. Let's hurry.
TooltipJournal,"Previous entries have disappeared. Because of the crash, I think."
TooltipImageCore,Machine core is severely damaged.
TooltipButtonFixEngine,"Happily, we can fix the core by analyzing artifacts found with drone."
TooltipTriangle,"This deck is adapted for oxygen synthesis. Minerals roasting, then water splitting and voila."
TooltipSliders,"Proportion consists of three mineral types mixed. Min amount of one mineral type is 1, max is 7."
TooltipButtonSynthFuel,"Each probe can be true or false. We must choose mix proportion wisely, because drone can't found much minerals."
TooltipPanelArtifacts,Objects found in the desert. Very strange sometimes. Analyze them to fix the machine.
TooltipButtonAnalyzeArtifact,"We can get additional info about artifact. It will be destroyed, but that's fine."
TooltipPanelMap,It's a desert. Scanner data can't go wrong. All the water has vanished somehow...
TooltipButtonSendDrone,My drone must be somewhere in the sands. It was disconnected from system because of the wreckage.
