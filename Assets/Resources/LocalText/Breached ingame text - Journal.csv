Let me tell you about first contact.<br>There was life in the ocean of Europa.<br><br>Squids: each was big as Memorial Tower in Neo-Tokyo.<br>About 60 white-eyed squids. We tried to speak to them with flashlights.<br>No response. We started to heat them up.<br>No response. We… killed one.<br>No response at all.<br><br>Seems like The Great Filter Theory is true.<br>We, VR-escapists, became squids too.<br>Who will heat us up?.."
Journal6,Day six.<br><br>The Hermit Towers are ruined too.<br>Hermits wandered in the worlds of VR alone.<br>Locked in a autonomous constructions. Lost.<br>Robots.
